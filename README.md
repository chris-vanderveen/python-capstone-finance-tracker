# python-capstone-finance-tracker
This is the repository for my capstone python project in the Summer 2025 Cognizant GenAI externship.

Personal Finance Tracker is a simple CLI application that allows the user to enter and track financial expenses using all concepts
covered in the Introduction to Python module.

## Running Personal Finance Tracker:
Simply clone the repository, `cd` into the directory, and run the Python script with the following commands:
```
  git clone https://github.com/chris-vanderveen/python-capstone-finance-tracker.git && cd python-capstone-finance-tracker
  python finance_tracker.py
```

## Python Concepts Implemented:
- Python basics (variables, control flow, loops, primitive types, etc.)
- Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.)
- Python functions
- Python error checking (try, except, etc.)
